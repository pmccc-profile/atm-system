Next Step(s):
 
Thinking of the following:
Masking (*) the PIN (at enter PIN) and Account Balance (at Official Receipt),
Hashing the account password, which is hard-coded due to its simulation and testing environment only;    	   hence seems unnecessary.
Add and/or improve error handling for better user experience.
		

FINAL: For the meantime, I'll leave this software program as it is.
